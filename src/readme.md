# 🧑‍💼 Employee Management System – CodVeda Internship Task 1

This project is part of **Task 1** for the **Java Development Internship at CodVeda**.  
It is a **console-based Java application** designed to manage employee records efficiently using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Employee Management System** provides a simple and interactive interface for managing employee data.  
Users can **Add**, **View**, **Update**, and **Delete** employee details through a menu-driven console UI.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice **OOP concepts** in Java
- Gain hands-on experience with **ArrayList**, **Scanner**, and user-defined methods
- Understand real-world implementation of a data-driven application
- Learn how to modularize and structure a Java project

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ **Add Employee**  
Prompt the user to enter employee ID, name, and salary, then store it.

✅ **View Employees**  
Displays all stored employee records with formatted output.

✅ **Update Employee**  
Update the name and salary of an employee by ID.

✅ **Delete Employee**  
Delete an employee record by ID.

✅ **Exit**  
Gracefully terminates the application.

# 🌲 Binary Search Tree – CodVeda Internship Task 2

This project is part of **Task 2** of my **Java Development Internship at CodVeda**.  
It involves implementing a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with core operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and tree traversals using Java.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a hierarchical data structure that stores data in a sorted manner for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.  
This console-based Java program provides an interactive way to perform various BST operations and understand the internal structure of binary trees.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply core **data structure** concepts in Java
- Gain a deeper understanding of **tree-based recursion**
- Practice implementing **insertion**, **deletion**, **search**, and **tree traversals**
- Strengthen coding logic through hierarchical structure manipulation

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

🔹 **Insert Node**  
Insert values into the BST while maintaining its ordered property.

🔹 **Delete Node**  
Delete nodes from the BST (with 0, 1, or 2 children) while preserving tree structure.

🔹 **Search Value**  
Search for a particular node value and return if it exists.

🔹 **Tree Traversals**  
- **In-order Traversal**: Left → Root → Right  
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Root → Left → Right  
- **Post-order Traversal**: Left → Right → Root

🔹 **User Menu**  
Interactive CLI (Command Line Interface) menu for user input.
